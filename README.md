# School Management System - Frontend

## Project Description

This project is the frontend of a **School Management System**, developed using **Vite** with **React**. The system allows users to manage school operations, including admin, staff, and librarian roles, with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). 

This frontend leverages **Tailwind CSS** for a responsive and modern UI, **Redux Toolkit** for state management, and **shadcn/ui** for accessible, customizable components. It is designed to handle features like user authentication, role-based navigation, and managing various resources like students, classes, and library books.
